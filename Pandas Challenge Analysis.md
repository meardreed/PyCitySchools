•	Summary

The complete data shows that from 15 schools the overall passing rate is 65%. When we dissect the data by school type, we observe that charters are top performers, whereas district schools are the lowest.

When we do further analysis and look at the schools by grade from 9 to 12th, at a glance we can see that students seem more inclined and/or proficient to reading than math, showing better grade in that category.

When we analyze the data by spending per students, we can observe that the schools with a smaller budget per student tend to perform better than the ones with a higher spending per student. Although the schools size shows better performance for schools with smaller number of students.

Another important observation is the school type analysis. Charter schools show better overall passing and scores for math and reading, resulting in 90% for overall passing for charters versus 54% for district schools.

•	Conclusions or comparisons from the calculations 

Although the complete data shows that students are more proficient at reading than math, with a passing rate of 85.81% for reading and 74.98% for math, students from charter schools tend to perform better when we compare the highest-performing and bottom ranks for overall passing rate regardless of the subject.

Students from the smaller size (<1000) schools show better performance for both math and reading, as well as overall passing. Whereas schools with 2000-5000 students demonstrate a weaker performance in all categories.
